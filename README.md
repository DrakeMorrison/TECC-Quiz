### Description:
##### "Timed First-Aid Quiz"

> Intended primarily for Non-Tactical Emergency Personnel during high-variability and high-risk engagements. Not intended for Civilians.

> Users log in each time they wish to save a friend. They can view the results of previous games and see their friend list.

> When they start a new game, they are presented with a question and several answers they have to pick between while they are timed.

> Should they answer correctly, the game asks them the next question. However, if they guess wrongly, they lose 10 seconds of time and still have to answer the next question!

> As they succeed and keep their friends alive, they accumulate points and awards for their rescues.
