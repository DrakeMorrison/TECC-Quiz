##### "Oral Hygiene Promotion App" for children
> Parents must create an account for access to the app. They are able to add up to 4 children associated with their account. These accounts can be deleted or added at any point.

> Child users log in each time they intend to brush their teeth. They can either view their previous brushing records or create a new brushing record.

> If child user opts to create a new brushing record, they are able to select 4 clips from a set of "mystery songs" to compile one 2-minute song. Once they have 4 selections, they are able to play their "custom" song.

> While the child user's "custom" song is playing, they receive step-by-step brushing instructions from an animated slideshow.

> Once the 2-minute animation and song duo is completed. The child receives a "sticker" for brushing. Brushing is limited to once per morning and once per evening.
